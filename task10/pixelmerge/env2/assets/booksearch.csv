By the River Piedra I Sat Down and Wept,Paulo Coelho,"This is the story of Pilar, an independent and practical yet restless young woman, whose life is forever changed by an encounter with a childhood friend.",2006-05,en,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=_Zk7PgAACAAJ&dq=paulo+coelho&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api
The Archer,Paulo Coelho,"In The Archer we meet Tetsuya, a man once famous for his prodigious gift with a bow and arrow but who has since retired from public life, and the boy who comes searching for him. The boy has many questions, and in answering them Tetsuya illustrates the way of the bow and the tenets of a meaningful life. Paulo Coelho's story suggests that living without a connection between action and soul cannot fulfil, that a life constricted by a fear of rejection or failure is not a life worth living. Instead, one must take risks, build courage and embrace the unexpected journey fate has to offer. With the wisdom, generosity, simplicity and grace that have made him an international bestseller, Paulo Coelho provides the framework for a rewarding life: hard work, passion, purpose, thoughtfulness, the willingness to fail and the urge to make a difference.",2020-11-16,en,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=HT0HEAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=paulo+coelho&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api
Zahir,Paulo Coelho,"„Fiecare poveste de dragoste este o călătorie“ – iată deviza sub care stă romanul al Paulo Coelho. Un scriitor stabilit la Paris, adulat de public,dar privit cu scepticism de critică, descoperă că soţia lui, corespondent de război,a dispărut fără urmă. A fost răpită, şantajată, ori s-a săturat de căsnicie pur şi simplu? Scriitorul începe s-o caute şi ajunge până în Asia Centrală. Soţia devine pentru el un „Zahir“, o entitate de neocolit, care îl tulbură până la obsesie şi să-l învăluie treptat în această stare de „posedare"" totală, pendulând incert între sfinţenie şi nebunie. Mai mult, „Zahirul“ îl smulge din siguranţa lumii sale şi îl mână, pe căi necunoscute, în căutarea unei noi înţelegeri despre esenţa iubirii şi forţa destinului. Cu Zahir, Paulo Coelho dă încă o dovadă a marelui său talent de povestitor captivant, dar oferă şi o perspectivă proprie asupra rosturilor fiinţei umane într-o lume plină de neprevăzut.",2014-04-30,ro,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=0H6OBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=paulo+coelho&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api
